# International Aid Hackathon: Desktop Entrepreneur Sales/Inventory Dashboard - Back End
This is the front end of a decoupled MERN Stack app with JWT Authentication. Please find the front end [here](https://github.com/international-aid-hackathon/team-3-frontend).

**To run this application locally on your computer, complete the following steps:**
To run the back end server, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can install Node at one of these websites: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm https://nodejs.org/en/download/. If you have Homebrew installed, just run brew install node from your console. 
Once you have Node installed, navigate into your back end directory, and install the project dependencies by entering `npm i` into your console.


Now, start the back end by entering into your console `npm start`. The app will run its back end in your web browser at http://localhost:3001/.

Follow the same steps for the front end `(https://github.com/international-aid-hackathon/team-3-frontend)`. Use console command `npm start` to start your front end. The React app will open a live version of the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/.
